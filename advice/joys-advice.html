			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>It's seems overwhelming and complex at first, but once you get going everything starts falling into place.  Push through those tough lessons and get over the little humps!</p>

			<p>It's ok to stop, take a break and come back to your code when you are stuck.  I've found that when I'm really stuck on a problem, I need to step back, do something else or sleep on it.  When I come back with a fresh mind I can usually solve the problem quickly.</p>

			<p>And don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>

			<p>Keep practicing! Keeping looking for inspiration!</p>

			<p>And most importantly enjoy learning a new skill and celebrate your accomplishments!</p>
